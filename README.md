# WizardQuest

## Demo
This game is deployed on Heroku.  Play it [here](https://tranquil-shore-27347.herokuapp.com/)

## This is the second group project 
   For the project we made a node express app that connects to a mysql database. The goal was to create a
   Point-and-Click style fantasy RPG.
   
### Objectives
* MVP
     * A working game that allows players to sign in
     * Keeps track of players progress through the game
     * Logic that determines battle outcome
     * Structured sequences based on the choice made by the user
     
### How it Works
* Once the game is open the user can either sign in, or create a new game
* Once the game is started the player will travel through the game to reach the final dungeon
* They will encounter battles where they will either:
     * Take damage
     * Get away safely
     * Beat the enemies and get some gold
* On the way the player can shop for potions or weapons
     * Potions restore health lost in fights
     * Weapons help get through battles
